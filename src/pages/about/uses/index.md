      Cultural heritage is important for historical research and education as
      well as establishing a sense of identity amongst communities. Through
      documenting the past, cultural heritage comes in both physical and
      intangible forms which include objects, monuments, beliefs, rituals and
      traditions. Scan the World collects stories from people and museums alike,
      to share various views on the importance and impact of culture, helping
      diversify our personal approach to art. As different individuals will have
      very different experiences and values within their own culture, this
      network provides a safe space for culture to be shared and discovered, no
      matter where in the world it comes from.

      What does a museum’s collection, a public sculpture or even a building
      mean to those who are partially sighted or blind? The traditionally
      enforced museum rule of ‘Do not touch’ makes accessing culture close to
      impossible for people who have visual impairments. Scan the World creates
      accurate representations of these objects with intricate detail through
      cost effective production which, in turn, provides someone with the
      incredible experience of touching and engaging with the artefacts.
      Similarly, for someone living in Australia wanting to explore the museum’s
      collection, the virtual archive not only allows people to ‘visit’ a
      collection wherever they are, but also to print it. The content scanned
      from numerous institutions can bring international collections together in
      one place for someone to explore at the comfort of their own home. Often,
      if they exist, museums will not have 3D data of their artefacts available
      to access or download for the public. With Scan the World, however, there
      are many objects that have been scanned and printed that can be viewed in
      its 3D platform or in its physical form, creating stimulated interaction
      and understanding of the craft involved.

      Many educational institutions are starting to think about how 3D
      technology can be useful for their students and there is added pressure to
      implement it into the school’s curriculum. Scan the World provides a
      platform for people to learn about the technology, from generating a
      digital representation of a scene or object (photography and
      photogrammetry software), to the manipulation of it  (zBrush/modelling
      software) and the output of 3D printing. Additionally, it teaches people
      about artefacts in ways which are interesting and interactive. Having
      access to its physical form and 3D virtual model makes it easier to
      understand what the artist is trying to portray and how they have achieved
      this by being able to move and touch it to study the transitions of space,
      angles and light.

      Damage or complete demolition of cultural sites can result in many
      consequences that would be detrimental for the community and the wider
      knowledge that has been gained. Not only would the documentation of the
      past be affected, but also the identities and significance of these that
      have formed from them. It is also likely that the loss could impact the
      economic benefits that the heritage site or monument can produce for the
      community it is in. This threat has become increasingly apparent in recent
      times with environmental changes and human conflicts across the globe.
      Scan the World’s intention is to simply preserve endangered cultural
      heritage by digitally producing facsimiles of these objects which in turn
      create valuable records of culture and history. 3D technology can be used
      as a means of restoration, using the data sets from the same sculptor or
      trends of the time to rebuild broken artefacts. Similarly, if the artefact
      has been completely destroyed, an entire copy can be made using the 3D
      data that has been collected from the original. As a result, potential
      risk of damage and destruction are mitigated.
