intro: >-
  Scan the World is an ambitious community-built initiative whose mission is to
  share 3D printable sculpture and cultural artefacts using democratised 3D
  scanning technologies, producing an extensive ecosystem of free to download
  digital cultural heritage. In making culture accessible, communities are
  encouraged to share their scans, stories, and creations with the goal to bring
  tangible heritage to the masses.
