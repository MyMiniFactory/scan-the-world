  Scan the World is an ambitious community-built initiative whose mission is to
  share objects of cultural significance using democratised 3D scanning
  technologies, producing an extensive ecosystem of content suitable for 3D

  their scans,  stories, and creations with the goal to bring global heritage to
  the masses.
